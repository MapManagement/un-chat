# Un Chat
"Un Chat" (french "un chat" means "a cat") is a chat application that includes the server and client program. This 
repository only includes the server instance which is written in Python and uses the gRPC framework. Python is not the
best choice for GUIs and that is why I am using C# and the .Net Framework WPF for any client instance. Furthermore, I 
document the whole path from creating this repo to working on new releases for the client and the server. Any learned
new learned stuff can be found in the [learning directory](/learning).

## Planning
All plans, features and ideas that probably will be part of "Un Chat" can be found here.
Additionally a regularly updated overview of all tasks and upcoming ideas to keep the project
well organized.
