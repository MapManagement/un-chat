# Un Chat
"Un Chat" (french "un chat" means "a cat") is a chat application including the server program but also the client
program. This repository only includes the server instance which is written in Python and using the gRPC framework.
That is why I am using C# and the .Net Framework WPF for any client instance since creating a GUI with Python is not as
comfortable and easy as in Python. Furthermore, I document the whole path from creating this repo to working on new
releases. Any learned thing can be found in the [learning directory](/learning).

## Planning
All plans, features and ideas that probably will be part of "Un Chat" can be found here.
Additonally a regularly updated overview of all tasks and upcoming ideas to keep the project
well organized.
